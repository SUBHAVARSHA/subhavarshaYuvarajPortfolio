                            completely automated car parking system with minimal
                            human interference. In our project we propose a smart
                            and automated car parking model that will help the
                            users to park their vehicles. This reduces the traffics in and around the systems and also time savings.</p>

                        <p>The proposed system aimed to develop a sunfilm for car windows that
                            effectively blocks ultraviolet (UV) radiation, thereby enhancing passenger comfort
                            and safety during car travel. The method proposed involved simulating sunlight
                            using an incandescent light bulb within a controlled environment, with
                            temperature sensors integrated into the sunfilm to measure the heat generated by
                            the simulated sunlight. An Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller was utilized to
                            process the temperature readings, which were then displayed in real-time on an
                            LCD screen for easy monitoring. The project comprised several key components,
                            including the development of the UV- blocking sunfilm, construction of the
                            experimental setup for simulating sunlight, integration of temperature sensors and
                            an Arduino microcontroller, and implementation of an LCD display for data
                            visualization. Calibration procedures were conducted to ensure the accuracy and
                            reliability of temperature measurements under varying light intensities.
                            Comprehensive testing evaluated the sunfilms performance under different light
                            conditions, comparing temperature changes with baseline readings to assess its
                            effectiveness in blocking UV radiation. The proposed method aimed at further
                            enhancing the sunfilms effectiveness and applicability in mitigating UV exposure
                            in automobiles.</p>

                        <p>The metaverse is a collective virtual shared space that merges virtually enhanced physical reality with persistent virtual environments. It is accessed through technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT). In the metaverse, users interact in real-time through customizable avatars, engaging in various activities such as gaming, socializing, working, and attending events. The metaverse features its own digital economy, where blockchain technology ensures ownership and transfer of digital assets, and digital currencies facilitate transactions. This convergence of physical and digital realities creates a dynamic and immersive user experience, shaping a new frontier for social interaction, entertainment, and commerce.</p>

                            the teaching-learning process, where the flexibility of access
                            to information inside or outside the classroom through an
                            avatar, tends to a paradigm shift in education traditional, in
                            terms of the way of transmitting and acquiring knowledge
                            through technological means. In this sense, an investigation
                            was carried out on the design, development and use of a
                            metaverse as a digital tool of didactic support to students of
                            the Faculty of Systems Engineering of the University of
                            Cundinamarca, with a view to establishing its viability to be
                            implemented in a course of mathematics and demonstrate
                            the possibilities offered by this type of resource to motivate
                            the student in his training. The metaverse design included
                            various ICT tools, thereby promoting self-learning and
                            collaborative learning. Finally, it was evaluated what was the
                            appreciation of a group of students against their interaction
                            with the metaverse, which validated its usefulness and
                            functionality inside and outside the classroom.</p>
